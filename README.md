# Drop7Gym

This is the RL project of group "State Space Invaders" for the course 
"Reinforcement Learning" in Fall '18.

The code base for the game relies partly on:
[this repo](https://github.com/Ram-N/Drop7). We refactored the code heavily, adapted 
the environment format of [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and adjusted core mechanics, 
to adjust to the true state of the game.
