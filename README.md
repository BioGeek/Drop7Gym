# Drop7Gym

This is the RL project of group "State Space Invaders" for the course 
"Reinforcement Learning" in Fall '18.

The code base for the game partly relies on:
[this repo](https://github.com/Ram-N/Drop7). We refactored the code heavily, adapted 
the environment format of [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and adjusted core mechanics, 
to adjust to the true state of the game.

Please refer to the folder "notebooks" for the following items: 
- "Introduction": Outlining the environment and how to use it.
- "Random Benchmark": Describing an Agent that takes random actions each move.
- "DQN": Training of a DQN model and describing the result.
- "Policy Gradient": Training of a Policy Gradient model and describing the result.
